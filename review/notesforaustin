 
Finished all the steps up until number 19 on the review, all thats left to do on the review is to start and finish the print stylesheet. There is some weird sizeing happening with the text on the navbar when you scale to a certain point aswell, so if you have time that needs debugging. The tutorial is also done, so don't worry about that. :P
